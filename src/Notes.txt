1. Testing libraries are pre built installed in the package.json
2. Jest is basically a testing library 
3. test is basically a jest function which we don't need to import
4. first we need to render the UI using the render method of testing library
5. we can get any attribute and reference of UI element using the "Sceeen" method of testing library
6. we can use the "describe" function to group the test cases 
7. we can also skip the testcases with the help of describe if we don't want to run them
8. We can create the nested describe method as well
9. for a semantic tag the role name should be same otherwise it may differ
10. fireEvent function is used to basicall play with the event change methods 
11. To declare the test file either use file extension as fileName.test.js or fileName.spec.js
12  To declare the test file without extension use a folder named as "__tests__"
13. We have "Before" and "After" hook which we performed without using use keyword
14. hooks are: beforeAll, beforeEach, afterAll and afterEach 
15. As name conveyed:
   a) beforeAll -> Will get run only once before all the testcases of a file only
   b) beforeEach -> Will get run everytime before running every test of a file only
   c) afterAll -> Will get run only once after all the testcases of a file only
   d) beforeAll -> Will get run everytime after running every test of a file only
16. Above hooks are used to perform some database clean operation majorly.
17. Snapshot Testing -> Mostly done at the end of the requirement, when all the features are completed
  then at that time we took a snapshot which will be a new file which almost contains the same content
  as the real file but don't exactly same, so whenever we made any change then it will show us that the
  new file changes is different from the previus one.
18. We should avoid testing for external UI library code as those are already tested by them, no need to 
   test the default functions of js and react.
19. We should test Component, UI element, custom function, api testing, event testing, props and state,
ui conditional testing.
20. We should make a standard for test coverage as nobody tests the 100% of the code
21. We can't test the custom function in the same way to test the custom function we should declare them 
in a separate helper.js then from there we can import them in test file and use them accordingly.
22. There are a concept of RTL queries to find the elements, to find the elements we can use
   a) By element type 
   b) By element name 
   c) By element id 
   d) By test id 
   e) etc 
 23. we have made above different ways because there can be a scenario where some of the field may be same
 so to uniqely identify the element we can take reference through multiple methods
 24. Type of RTL Queries 
    a) For Single element 
      -> getBy
      -> queryBy
      -> findBy
    b) For multiple elements
      -> getAllBy
      -> queryAllBy
      -> findAllBy
 25. Generally in test cases if we fetch the element using name then in html we need to define it label,
 if it's a self closing tag then we need to use the area-label attribute otherwise the text which we give 
 will be treated as the label.
 26. Priority order of RTL queries
    a) ByRole
    b) ByLabelText
    c) ByPlaceHolderText
    d) ByText 
    e) ByDisplayValue
    f) ByAltText
    g) ByTitle
    h) ByTestId
 27. Assertions Methods - These are the methods which we used after the expect function in the test file
 28. For text match - we can pass the attribute exact as false 
 29. There are three types of query 
    a) getBy
    b) queryBy
    c) findBy
 30. As we used to do query using the getBy in the same way we can do it using the queryBy
 31. While using the findBy query types we need to use the async and await
 32. Mostly we used findBy when we need to fetch the data from the API's 
 33. We can also get the reference of the element using the `document.querySelector([id,class, etc])`;
 34. Within function of react testing library is used to access the child elements of tag
 35. UserEvent is used to access the click event or fire event 
 36. It is used along with async await
